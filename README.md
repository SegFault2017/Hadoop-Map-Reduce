# Hadoop-Map-Reduce
Implemented BFS using Hadoop Map Reduce\
Compute the shortest path distance between two given nodes in a directed unweighted graph. The shortest path distance from node a to b is the minimum path length from a to b.

Input is listed in edge list format. Each line contains two number a  b, representing a directed edge from a to b.
For example\
1 2\
1 3\
1 4\
2 3\
2 5\
3 1\
3 2\
4 2\
4 5

Query:\
Find the shortest path distance from a to b. For example,\
2 4\
4 3


Out Put:\
3\
2
